                <h2>Viber blocked by Digicel and Lime</h2>
                <h3>October 1, 2020 by Milton Francis</h3>
                
                <p><img id='viber-img' src="viber.png" alt="viber image">The two largest telecommunications company in Jamaica, Lime and Digicel, 
                    in 2014, collectively blocked Voice Over IP (VOIP) application Viber from 
                    using their network infrastructure to allow its customers to make calls 
                    over the internet. Both Digicel and Lime ultimately blocked the VOIP 
                    application and outlined similar sentiments as to why they saw it fit to 
                    pull the plugs on Viber. The Chief Executive Officer of Digicel, in 2014, 
                    Jay Saunders said “unlicensed Voice Over IP operators like Viber use 
                    telecoms networks to deliver their services, but do not pay the requisite 
                    money for the privilege. Digicel believes that this unauthorized use of
                    its network amounts to illegal bypass activity.” Lime’s Chief Executive 
                    Officer James Pitt, in 2014, outlined similar reasons, "In order to
                    maintain network quality for our customers, Lime confirms it has been 
                    reviewing unauthorized access to its networks. As part of the review,
                    Lime will no longer carry Viber and Tango voice calling on our networks."

                    This is clearly a case of net neutrality and  it is of great importance 
                    to the future of the internet that telecommunications companies in Jamaica 
                    are made via legislations to allow any legitimate applications that their
                    customers would like to use access to their network.

                <h2>Net Neutrality</h2>
                <h3>November 4, 2018 by Odean Barnes</h3>
                <p>
                    <img id='net-neutral-img' src="net-neutral.jpg" alt="net neutrality">
                    Net Neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
                    must treat all Internet traffic as the same regardless of its kind, 
                    source, or destination. What Digicel and LIME did was clearly violating
                    this principle as they lobbied for external companies to pay for the
                    “privilege” of accessing their networks. Net Neutrality states that ISPs
                    should only be tasked with delivering the traffic to consumers without
                    filtering, screening or blocking what goes through the network.
                    This issue sets a dangerous precedent if Telecoms companies are continued
                    to be allowed free reign to do as they please without much regulation 
                    governing their activities. New regulations should be introduced and 
                    amendments made to the Telecommunications Act to enforce Net Neutrality. 
                    We propose that the OUR amends the core principles of Net Neutrality into 
                    the Telecommunications Act and uphold these new regulations against all 
                    Telecoms companies in Jamaica. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Net Neutrality allows a free, open, competitive market which boosts 
                    innovation. Companies will not need to pay for preferential treatment or 
                    access to an ISP’s customers and will have guaranteed access and speeds 
                    regardless of what ISP a consumer uses. Many economists also agree that 
                    Net Neutrality prevents larger companies from forcing out smaller start-ups 
                    because the larger company pays for faster speeds and more preferential 
                    treatment than the smaller start-up [6]. This stifles competition and 
                    innovation which is bad for Jamaica’s future. Net Neutrality prevents this.
